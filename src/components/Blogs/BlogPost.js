    content: `
  <h2><strong>Introduction</strong></h2>
  <p>Hello, I'm Mayured Khole, and this is my journey from a non-technical background to becoming a proficient MERN stack developer.</p>
  <p>My journey began with a spark of curiosity about technology, despite never having pursued it professionally. Starting from scratch was daunting, yet it was the beginning of an enlightening path. By setting clear, achievable goals, such as understanding the basics of web development and finding the right resources, I gradually built my foundation.</p>
  <p>Resources like FreeCodeCamp, MDN Web Docs, and various YouTube channels provided the knowledge, while hands-on practice through building projects helped solidify my skills. Engaging with a community of fellow learners and diving deeper into technologies like MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js (MERN stack) broadened my expertise and prepared me for professional challenges.</p>
  <h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
  <p>My transition into the tech industry culminated in securing a job as a MERN stack developer, marking a significant milestone in my career. This journey, filled with continuous learning and real-world application, has been incredibly rewarding.</p>
